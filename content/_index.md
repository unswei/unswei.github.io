**We make robots that stay safe and useful over time.**  
We study how robots learn, plan, and act reliably, individually and in teams.

Our research focuses on:
- multi-robot systems under uncertainty  
- data-efficient embodied learning and manipulation  
- learning and inference methods for physical systems  

We are interested in approaches that combine learning, probabilistic reasoning, and real-world experimentation, with an emphasis on efficiency, robustness, and physical grounding.

The embodied intelligence and collective robotics lab is based at UNSW and led by [Oliver Obst](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/oliver-obst). We expect to host PhD projects aligned with these [research themes](/research/) and welcome [informal enquiries](mailto:o.obst@unsw.edu.au?subject=Prospective%20PhD%20student) from prospective students.
