Blackwell supports Python 3.10 and newer. Continuous integration exercises Linux/Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12, and macOS/Python 3.13; other JAX-supported combinations may work but are not part of the current validation matrix.

The dependency remains `jax>=0.6`. Python 3.10 selects JAX 0.6.2, while newer Python versions can use newer compatible JAX releases. The development lockfile records these separate resolutions. Release verification installs the built wheel in clean Python 3.10–3.13 environments before publication.

## CPU

The default dependency installs standard JAX. CPU is sufficient for the examples and often fastest to set up for low-dimensional estimators.

```console
python -c "import jax; print(jax.default_backend()); print(jax.devices())"
```

## GPU and TPU

Blackwell deliberately does not pin accelerator-specific JAX wheels. Install the suitable build from the [official JAX installation guide](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html), then install Blackwell in the same environment.

Accelerators provide the clearest benefit for large particle sets, batched Monte Carlo evaluation and large model batches. For one small EKF, compilation and transfer overhead can outweigh faster device arithmetic.

## Apple silicon

The standard CPU backend is the supported path on macOS. Blackwell does not currently test experimental Metal acceleration.

## Embedded NVIDIA platforms

Jetson/JetPack validation is not yet part of the release matrix. JAX wheel, CUDA, cuDNN and Python compatibility must be matched to the device image. Treat deployment as an integration exercise and record the full software stack with performance results.

## Precision

JAX defaults to 32-bit floating point in many environments. Enable 64-bit mode before creating arrays when conditioning or long-horizon consistency demands it:

```python
from jax import config

config.update("jax_enable_x64", True)
```

Use one dtype consistently across state, controls, measurements and covariance parameters. A dtype change causes JIT recompilation.
