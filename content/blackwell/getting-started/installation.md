Blackwell requires Python 3.10 or newer. Install the latest release from PyPI.

### pip

```console
python -m pip install blackwell
```

### uv

```console
uv add blackwell
```

Verify the installation:

```console
python -c "import blackwell; print(blackwell.__version__)"
```

The current release reports version `0.0.3`, which adds Python 3.10 support to the SE(3) API introduced in `0.0.2`. Upgrade an existing installation with `python -m pip install --upgrade blackwell`. Blackwell remains pre-alpha: the supported surface is deliberately small, and API changes are possible before version 1.0.

## Python and JAX versions

Blackwell requires `jax>=0.6`. JAX declares which Python versions each release supports, so installers select a compatible version automatically:

- Python 3.10 selects JAX 0.6.2.
- Python 3.11 and newer can select newer compatible JAX releases.

The installer uses the interpreter running the command; having a newer Python installed does not change an existing Python 3.10 environment. To choose 3.11:

```console
python3.11 -m pip install --upgrade blackwell jax
```

Existing environments may retain an already installed compatible JAX version. Use `--upgrade` when you want to update it. For development, the universal `uv.lock` records separate resolutions for each Python version:

```console
uv sync --locked --all-extras --python 3.10
# Or select a newer interpreter and its corresponding locked JAX version:
uv sync --locked --all-extras --python 3.11
```

## JAX platform choice

The core dependency installs the standard JAX build. CPU execution is enough for the examples and many small localisation problems. GPU and TPU packages are deliberately not pinned because the correct wheel depends on your accelerator, driver and platform.

Follow the [official JAX installation guide](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html) for accelerator support.

<div class="blackwell-docs-note">
<p><strong>Install JAX once.</strong> If your environment already has an accelerator-specific JAX installation, install Blackwell into the same environment. Avoid replacing it afterwards with an incompatible CPU-only wheel.</p>
</div>

## Optional plotting support

Examples run without plotting. To save their Matplotlib figures, clone the repository and install the plotting extra:

```console
git clone https://github.com/unswei/blackwell.git
cd blackwell
python -m pip install -e ".[plot]"
python examples/se2_localisation.py --plot localisation.png
```

## Development checkout

Blackwell uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for its reproducible environment:

```console
git clone https://github.com/unswei/blackwell.git
cd blackwell
uv sync --all-extras
uv run pytest
```

Continue with the [five-minute localisation](/blackwell/getting-started/quickstart/), or read [Platforms and JAX](/blackwell/help/platforms/) for backend notes.

## Development version

To test the current `main` branch before the next release, install directly from GitHub:

```console
python -m pip install "blackwell @ git+https://github.com/unswei/blackwell.git@main"
```

Development versions may contain unreleased API changes. Prefer the PyPI release for reproducible work.
